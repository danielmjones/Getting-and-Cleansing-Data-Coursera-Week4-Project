#Getting and Cleansing Data Coursera Week4 Project Codebook

>The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The full data set can be obtained here with further information about the original data.

The dataset has been processed using run_analysis.R to create the tidydata.txt file.

The data set contains 180 rows of data with 69 variables.

All variables are numeric except for 'Activity' which is a factor of the six activities - (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 

The 69 variables are:
